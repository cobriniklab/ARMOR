MissingOutputException in line 704 of /dataVolume/storage/single_cell_projects/sc_RB_devel/FACS_20190501_sunlee_H_sapiens_proj/ARMOR/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:

This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
